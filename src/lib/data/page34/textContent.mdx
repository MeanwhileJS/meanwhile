A PROMISE

TO AMERICA

Kevin D. Roberts, PhD

F
orty-four years ago, the United States and the conservative movement were

in dire straits. Both had been betrayed by the Washington establishment

and were uncertain whom to trust. Both were internally splintered and stra
-

tegically adrift. Worse still, at that moment of acute vulnerability and division, we

found ourselves besieged by existential adversaries, foreign and domestic. The late

1970s were by any measure a historic low point for America and the political coa

lition dedicated to preserving its unique legacy of human flourishing and freedom.

Today, America and the conservative movement are enduring an era of division

and danger akin to the late 1970s. Now, as then, our political class has been discred
-

ited by wholesale dishonesty and corruption. Look at America under the ruling

and cultural elite today: Inflation is ravaging family budgets, drug overdose deaths

continue to escalate, and children suffer the toxic normalization of transgender
-

ism with drag queens and pornography invading their school libraries. Overseas,

a totalitarian Communist dictatorship in Beijing is engaged in a strategic, cultural,

and economic Cold War against America’s interests, values, and people—all while

globalist elites in Washington awaken only slowly to that growing threat. Moreover,

low-income communities are drowning in addiction and government dependence.

Contemporary elites have even repurposed the worst ingredients of 1970s “radical

chic” to build the totalitarian cult known today as “The Great Awokening.” And

now, as then, the Republican Party seems to have little understanding about what

to do. Most alarming of all, the very moral foundations of our society are in peril.

Yet students of history will note that, notwithstanding all those challenges,

the late 1970s proved to be the moment when the political Right unified itself
