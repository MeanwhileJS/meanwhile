        <AccordionItem value="goal">
        <AccordionTrigger invert>What is the main goal of this chapter?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            The chapter's main goal is to provide guidance on structuring the White House Office (WHO) and the Executive Office of the President (EOP). However, it frames this guidance in ways that prioritize loyalty to the President over broader institutional checks, stating that "their agenda must therefore be the President's agenda." This raises concerns about sidelining independence and fostering an over-concentration of power.

        <AccordionTrigger invert>What issues does this chapter aim to address?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            The chapter focuses on streamlining White House operations to implement the President's agenda effectively. However, its repeated emphasis on loyalty and centralized control risks undermining diverse perspectives and reducing the independence of staff who might offer critical input.

    <Accordion type="single" collapsible defaultValue="staff-management">
        <AccordionItem value="staff-management">
        <AccordionTrigger invert>How does this chapter propose to manage White House staff?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            It stresses the role of the Chief of Staff in enforcing a rigid hierarchy, with "clear lines of authority and responsibility to avoid conflicts." While this may ensure efficiency, it also prioritizes centralized control, potentially stifling debate and dissent.

        <AccordionItem value="loyalty">
        <AccordionTrigger invert>What role does loyalty play in staff selection and management?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Loyalty is central. Statements like, "The President must rely on the men and women appointed to the WHO," suggest that alignment with the President's agenda takes precedence over qualifications or independent expertise. This focus raises concerns about partisanship and reduced accountability.

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Transparency and Accountability</h3>
    <div className="mb-6 p-3 bg-white border border-gray-300 rounded-md">
    <Accordion type="single" collapsible defaultValue="transparency">
        <AccordionItem value="transparency">
        <AccordionTrigger invert>Does the chapter address transparency or public accountability?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            Transparency is mentioned briefly, but the text downplays its importance in favor of efficiency. For example, it suggests minimizing "bureaucratic delays caused by unnecessary layers of oversight," implying that streamlining operations may come at the cost of transparency and accountability.

        <AccordionItem value="risks">
        <AccordionTrigger invert>What are the potential risks of reduced oversight?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            By emphasizing efficiency and centralization, the chapter risks sidelining mechanisms that ensure checks and balances. The phrase "streamlining processes ensures that the executive branch can operate free from interference by external entities" suggests a potential erosion of democratic accountability.

        <AccordionTrigger invert>What are the long-term consequences of these proposals?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            The long-term effects could include an over-concentration of power within the executive branch, diminished transparency, and the exclusion of diverse perspectives. The focus on loyalty over expertise may also lead to inefficiencies in decision-making and implementation.

        <AccordionContent>
            Career professionals and independent thinkers may find themselves excluded if their views diverge from the administration's priorities. This could lead to a homogenized and less innovative governing body.

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Ethical Considerations</h3>

        <AccordionItem value="ethics">
        <AccordionTrigger invert>Does this chapter address potential ethical challenges?</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
            The chapter does not explicitly address ethical concerns, such as how loyalty-driven staffing could lead to conflicts of interest or unethical decision-making. Its framing of the White House Counsel as an "activist yet ethical plaintiffs' firm" raises additional concerns about impartiality.
