The American presidency has always been a key part of the nation's identity. It plays a big role in movies, TV shows, and books. Many people analyze and study it. This manual is based on the experiences of presidential appointees and shares lessons for future use.

## What the Constitution Says

The U.S. Constitution gives the President the “executive power.” It makes the President the “Commander in Chief” of the armed forces and requires the President to ensure laws are faithfully executed. It also says the President can ask for advice from department leaders.

From George Washington’s presidency onward, every President has had staff working in the White House and a Cabinet made up of department heads.

## Serving in the White House Office (WHO)

Working in the White House is one of the most important and demanding jobs in the government. The President depends on the men and women of the WHO because one person cannot handle everything. These staff members help carry out the President’s agenda and make decisions that affect the country.
