    "The Independent Regulatory Agencies section critiques existing frameworks for financial, media, and electoral regulation. Key proposals include reducing the influence of independent oversight in favor of executive-driven or market-oriented reforms. Critics argue these changes could lead to reduced transparency, increased influence of money in politics, and monopolistic practices.",
