It is meant to guide the next Republican president in reshaping the federal government. The plan covers changes to many areas, including how decisions are made in the White House, how agencies work, and what policies the government should follow.

          <AccordionTrigger invert>Isn't this just normal politics?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p>
              While it's normal for political groups to propose ideas, <strong>Project 2025</strong> stands out because of its scale and focus. It doesn't just suggest policies; it plans to restructure the federal government in ways that could concentrate power and reduce oversight. This isn't just politics as usual—it's a roadmap for dramatic change.

        <AccordionItem value="who-behind">
          <AccordionTrigger invert>Who is behind Project 2025?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p>
              The project is led by the Heritage Foundation, a powerful conservative think tank, with contributions from other right-leaning organizations. These groups have a long history of advocating for smaller government, reduced regulations, and conservative social policies. Their funding comes from major donors, corporations, and political groups with strong ideological goals.

        <AccordionItem value="efficiency">
          <AccordionTrigger invert>Isn't the goal just to make government more efficient?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p>
              Efficiency is one of the key terms used in <strong>Project 2025</strong>, but it often means removing oversight and consolidating power in the executive branch. While efficiency can be good, it should not come at the cost of transparency, accountability, and the checks and balances that keep democracy fair.

        <AccordionItem value="centralization">
          <AccordionTrigger invert>What's wrong with centralizing power?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p>
              Centralizing power may make decisions faster, but it also reduces the input of other branches of government and the public. This could weaken democracy by concentrating control in the hands of a few people, making it harder to hold leaders accountable.

        <AccordionItem value="policy-ideas">
          <AccordionTrigger invert>Aren't these just policy ideas? Why should I worry?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p>
              While these are currently just ideas, they are designed to become real policies under a supportive administration. The Heritage Foundation is highly influential, and their recommendations could directly shape government actions, potentially affecting laws, public services, and individual rights.

          <AccordionTrigger invert>How does this affect me?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p>
              If implemented, the proposals in <strong>Project 2025</strong> could change how government services are provided, who gets access to them, and how much control ordinary people have over decisions. Policies on healthcare, education, and the environment could be drastically altered in ways that may not benefit everyone equally.

        <AccordionItem value="democratic">
          <AccordionTrigger invert>Are these proposals democratic?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            <p>
              Many parts of <strong>Project 2025</strong> prioritize loyalty to a specific political agenda and centralize power in the executive branch. This raises concerns about whether the proposals uphold democratic values like accountability, transparency, and fairness.
