# A Deep Dive into Project 2025

Project 2025 is a comprehensive plan developed by the Heritage Foundation and over 100 conservative organizations to guide the next Republican presidential administration. Released in 2023, it outlines a conservative agenda across various federal agencies, aiming to reshape U.S. government policies and structures. Key proposals include consolidating executive power, reintroducing Schedule F to facilitate replacing federal workers with political appointees, and removing the abortion pill from the market. The plan also suggests eliminating the Department of Education and rolling back LGBTQ+ protections. While former President Donald Trump has distanced himself from Project 2025, many of its contributors are former Trump administration officials, indicating potential alignment with his policies.
