T
his work,
 
Mandate for Leadership 2025: The Conservative Promise
, is a col
-

lective effort of hundreds of volunteers who have banded together in the

spirit of advancing positive change for America. Our work is by no means

the comprehensive compendium of conservative policies, nor is our group the

exclusive cadre of conservative thinkers. The ideas expressed in this volume are

not necessarily shared by all. What unites us is the drive to make our country better.

First and foremost, we thank the chapter authors and contributors who gave

so freely of their time in service of their country.

We were particularly grateful to have the help of dedicated members of The

Heritage Foundation’s management and policy teams. Executive Vice President

Derrick Morgan, Chief of Staff Wesley Coopersmith, Associate Director of Project

2025 Spencer Chretien, and Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies

Director Paul Ray devoted a significant amount of their valuable time to reviewing

and editing the lengthy manuscript and provided expert advice and insight.

The job of transforming the work of dozens of authors and hundreds of

contributors into a cohesive manuscript fell upon Heritage’s formidable team of

editors led by Director of Research Editors Therese Pennefather, Senior Editor

William T. Poole, Marla Hess, Jessica Lowther, Karina Rollins, and Kathleen

Scaturro, without whose tireless efforts you would not be reading these words.

The talented work of Data Graphics Services Manager John Fleming, Manager of

Web Development and Print Projects Jay Simon, Director of Marketing Elizabeth

Fender, Senior Graphic Designer Grace Desandro, and Senior Designer Melissa

Bluey came together to bring the volume to life. We also thank the dedicated junior

staff who provided immeasurable assistance, especially Jordan Embree, Sarah

Calvis, and Jonathan Moy.

Most important, we are grateful to the leadership, supporters, and donors of

each of the Project 2025 advisory board member organizations and those of The

Heritage Foundation, without whom Project 2025 would not be possible.

Thank you.
