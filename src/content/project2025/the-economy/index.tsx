    "The Economy section details policy proposals aimed at streamlining commerce, reducing regulatory barriers, and enhancing free-market competitiveness. Key areas include tax reforms favoring corporations and high-income earners, debates over the future of institutions like the Exportâ€“Import Bank, and a reevaluation of monetary policy through Federal Reserve reforms. Small businesses are encouraged through deregulation, although limited focus is given to inclusivity. Trade policy emphasizes globalization and market liberalization, presenting both opportunities and risks for domestic industries.",
