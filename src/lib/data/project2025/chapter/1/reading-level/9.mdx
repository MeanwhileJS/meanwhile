# White House Office  
*Rick Dearborn*

The American presidency has always been a big part of our national identity, showing up in movies, TV shows, and books that analyze and critique it. The presidency is seen as the center of our country’s power and reputation. However, nothing beats experiencing it firsthand. This guide, based on real experiences of people who have worked in the White House, makes that information easy to understand and ready for future use.

To understand the presidency, we should start with the Constitution, the foundation of our government. The Constitution gives the President "executive power," makes them the "Commander in Chief," and requires that they ensure laws are carried out. It also allows the President to get help from top officials in each executive department. Since George Washington’s time, every President has had a White House staff and a Cabinet made up of department leaders to help them.

Since the late 1700s, people have dedicated their time and skills to help defend and build up our country by working for the President. Serving in the White House Office (WHO) has become a proud tradition and is considered one of the toughest jobs in government.

The President has to count on the people they appoint to the WHO because there’s just too much to handle alone. Delegating tasks isn’t just a good idea; it’s necessary. The decisions of the President’s team affect the entire Administration, its reputation, and even the future of the country. That’s why the President needs to choose people who will stay focused on the same goals. Picking the right team is one of the first and most important choices a President makes, and it sets the direction for the Administration from day one.

### Chief of Staff

As with most of the positions that will be covered in this first chapter, the Chief of Staff is also an Assistant to the President. However, the chief is truly first among equals. Of all presidential staff members, the chief is the most critical to implementation of the President's vision for the country. The chief also has a dual role as manager of the staffs of both the WHO and the Executive Office of the President (EOP).

The Chief of Staff's first managerial task is to establish an organizational chart for the WHO. It should be simple and contain clear lines of authority and responsibility to avoid conflicts. It should also identify specific points of contact for each element of the government outside of the White House. These contacts should include the White House Liaisons who are selected by the Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO).

Receiving guidance from the President, the chief endeavors to implement the President's agenda by setting priorities for the WHO. This process begins by taking stock of the President's campaign promises, identifying current and prospective opportunities, and then delegating policy priorities among the departments and agencies of the Cabinet and throughout the three White House policy councils:

- The National Economic Council (NEC)
- The Domestic Policy Council (DPC)
- The National Security Council (NSC)

The President is briefed on all of his policy priorities by his Cabinet and senior staff as directed by the chief. The chief—along with senior WHO staff—maps out the issues and themes that will be covered daily and weekly. The chief then works with the policy councils, the Cabinet, and the Office of Communications and Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA) to sequence and execute the rollout of policies and announcements. White House Counsel and senior advisers and senior counselors are also intimately involved.

All senior staff report to the Chief of Staff, either directly or through his two or three deputies, unless the President determines that a particular Assistant to the President reports directly to him. Most chiefs have interacted directly with Cabinet officers and a select number of direct reports. In most cases, the direct reports to the chief are his two or three deputies, the Communications Director, PPO Director, White House Counsel, and senior advisers. Occasionally, the Office of Public Liaison (OPL), the Cabinet Secretary, and Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA) also report directly to the chief. Usually, however, they report instead to a Deputy Chief of Staff.

The Chief of Staff's main challenge is time management. His use of his deputies, meetings with senior staff, and direction provided to the WHO must all balance with the daily needs of the President. A successful chief steers the West Wing using his management of and influence with the various individuals and entities around him. It goes without saying that selecting the right person to be chief is vital.

### Deputy Chiefs of Staff

In recent years, Presidents typically have appointed two Deputy Chiefs of Staff:

1. **Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations**
2. **Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy**

There also have been other types of deputy chiefs whose roles have included, for example, overseeing strategy, planning, and implementation. Chiefs of Staff have then occasionally appointed a principal Deputy Chief to be in charge of guiding decision-making, organizational structure, and information flow.

### Principal Deputy Chiefs of Staff

Not all Chiefs of Staff have chosen a principal deputy. One reason is that adding another layer of command can make things more complicated. When there is a principal deputy, their role depends on what the Chief of Staff needs. Most principal deputies help manage action items, handling those they can and passing up important ones to the Chief of Staff or the President. They often take charge of scheduling and work closely with policy councils as directed by the Chief of Staff. The Office of Public Liaison (OPL) and the Office of Political Affairs (OPA) may also report to the principal deputy.

- **Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations**: This deputy manages the President’s schedule and all logistics, from Air Force One and Marine One travel to ground transportation. They work directly with the Secret Service and the military offices that protect the President and his family. This deputy also collaborates with the National Security Council (NSC), the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Intelligence Community on foreign trips. Additionally, this role covers all White House operations—technology, maintenance, staff support, and administration. This person needs to be very organized and ideally has experience in managing complex systems.

- **Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy**: This deputy handles key roles within the White House Office, often including the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA), Office of Public Liaison (OPL), and other advisory offices. For conservative Administrations, this role could bridge the White House with state and local leaders, political organizations, and grassroots groups. Working with the Chief of Staff, the Cabinet, and policy councils, this deputy helps shape and carry out the President’s goals. Ideally, this deputy has strong experience in economic, domestic, and social policy.

### Senior Advisers

Presidents often choose senior advisers for their broad experience and advice on politics and communication. Senior advisers may also take charge of specific projects or policy areas as “czars.” These advisers usually have close, trusted relationships with the President and often give input on both policy and how to communicate effectively with the public and the media.

In some cases, new offices or councils are created to support senior advisers. Even if these offices may be temporary, it’s important that advisers have the resources they need to accomplish their goals. The Chief of Staff must also make sure these advisers have clearly defined roles that are understood by others in the White House.

### Office of White House Counsel

The Office of White House Counsel offers legal advice to the President and the Executive Office on various issues, including presidential powers, ethics, and clemency applications. Choosing the White House Counsel is one of the most important decisions for an incoming President. The Counsel's office doesn’t create or push policies; its role is to make sure the President’s agenda stays within the law.

While the White House Counsel doesn’t serve as the President’s personal attorney, it can be hard to separate personal matters from official ones. The Counsel should be loyal to both the President’s goals and the legal limits. They also must ensure that the entire White House staff follows legal and ethical rules, including conflict of interest checks, financial disclosures, and training sessions.

The Counsel’s office also coordinates with the Department of Justice (DOJ) on important matters and serves as a link between the White House and DOJ. This relationship helps the President stay informed on ongoing legal challenges across the government that might impact their agenda.

The White House Counsel’s office is responsible for giving timely legal guidance in a fast-paced environment, often on issues with limited precedent. This requires teamwork within the White House and with DOJ to make sure the President gets the best legal advice.

The President should select a Counsel with broad legal experience, including constitutional and regulatory law, as well as knowledge of Congress and politics. While an impressive legal background helps, the most important qualities are loyalty to the President and to the Constitution.

### Staff Secretary

The Office of the Staff Secretary isn’t widely known but plays a vital role in the White House by managing the flow of information in and out of the Oval Office. Like a gatekeeper, the Staff Secretary ensures that the President has all the information needed to make decisions. This position requires someone who is trusted to be neutral and to prioritize information for the President.

The Staff Secretary reviews materials headed for the President, including decision memos, bills from Congress, and briefing books. This role is key in deciding who weighs in on policy matters and in ensuring that all information reaching the President is complete and current.

The Staff Secretary also helps with outgoing information by directing follow-up questions and revision requests to the right departments. They handle the President’s briefing book, which provides critical information each day to aid in decision-making, and manage official documents like the President’s signature.

### Office of Communications

The Office of Communications, led by the Communications Director, shares the President’s agenda with the public through speeches, press briefings, interviews, and social media. In some Administrations, it includes the Press Secretary’s office, but regardless of structure, it works closely with the Press Office, speechwriters, and digital teams.

Key responsibilities include setting up press briefings, interviews, and speeches while building strong relationships with media organizations. The Office of Communications also coordinates with various White House teams to ensure that the Administration shares a unified message with the public.

The President is the most powerful resource for communicating the White House’s message, so speeches and addresses like the State of the Union set the tone. The Communications Director and Press Secretary must make sure their information aligns with the President’s message.

Speechwriters play an important role, requiring both policy knowledge and a strong grasp of history and communication to capture the President’s voice.

The Press Secretary serves as the President’s spokesperson, delivering messages to the public and responding to media questions. This role requires someone who can think quickly and respond effectively to challenges from reporters.

The Communications Director’s job is to ensure that the President’s message is communicated clearly and effectively, especially to the mainstream media. This person must be aware of the activities across the White House to keep a consistent narrative.

### Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA)

Created by President Eisenhower, the OLA is the link between the White House and Congress, helping to confirm presidential nominees and pass legislation. Since Congress controls federal funding, it’s important for the OLA to maintain support in the legislature to fund the President’s agenda.

OLA works under the Chief of Staff’s guidance, sometimes with input from a Deputy Chief of Staff. It has direct influence on congressional leaders from both major parties, working to mediate and build consensus to pass the President’s policies.

Like the Office of Communications, the OLA must ensure that Congress hears one clear message from the White House. If different offices send mixed messages, it can make the Administration’s agenda look disorganized.

Internally, OLA staff participate in policy discussions and budget reviews, providing advice on what Congress is likely to support. Externally, they work with Congress to gather enough votes to pass the President’s priorities.

The OLA staff needs to be skilled in both policy and politics, able to communicate effectively and realistically about what policies are feasible.

Most importantly, the OLA should operate smoothly as a unified team. The President cannot afford to have team members working in opposition to one another.

### Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO)

The saying “personnel is policy,” popularized under President Ronald Reagan, is especially true in the White House, where the PPO handles political appointments. The PPO was created by President Nixon to centralize political hiring. While departments have legal authority over some hiring, the President makes the final call on political roles in the executive branch.

The PPO’s main job is to staff the government with people who will help carry out the President’s agenda. This includes filling around 1,000 Senate-confirmed roles as well as 3,000 political positions that require loyal, dedicated individuals to support the Administration.

The PPO has several duties, including:

- Actively seeking potential candidates for political roles and evaluating resumes.
- Vetting potential candidates through background checks and working with departments on security clearances.
- Making hiring recommendations to the President.
- Working with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to support the President’s authority over the federal workforce.
- Training and connecting political appointees.
- Overseeing personnel decisions, including hirings and firings.
- Maintaining links between conservative groups and the executive branch.

The PPO hires over 100 people during a presidential transition and manages thousands of non-career positions during the first term. A strong relationship with the President is crucial for the PPO Director to effectively oversee hiring and ensure the Administration’s goals are met.

The PPO also focuses on long-term staffing needs, helping develop future leaders who may take on senior roles. By ensuring a steady team of political staff at different levels, the PPO helps maintain stability and readiness for the Administration.

### Office of Political Affairs (OPA)

The OPA is the main office handling the President’s political interests. Its exact functions can vary, but it often acts as a bridge between the President and political groups, national committees, and campaigns. The OPA may also work within legal boundaries to support the President’s reelection, handle casework, and track political developments in Congress.

The OPA is key in connecting the White House with the President’s political party. This helps the President’s goals reach political groups and helps the White House understand their needs and concerns. The OPA has a director of political affairs who reports to either the Chief of Staff or a Deputy Chief of Staff, along with regional deputy directors responsible for different parts of the country.

Since most White House activities have political elements, the OPA stays informed on everything from travel and policy to speeches and nominations. The OPA works closely with other White House offices, the Cabinet, and federal agencies to consider how actions might impact the President’s image and support.

### Office of Cabinet Affairs (OCA)

The OCA makes sure communication between the White House and Cabinet is coordinated. It organizes and manages Cabinet meetings with the President and holds regular meetings with Deputy Secretaries, who often step in for Cabinet members when they resign.

The Cabinet Secretary, who reports to the Chief of Staff, leads the OCA and works directly with all Cabinet members. Deputies and special assistants within the OCA support the Cabinet Secretary by working with senior staff in each department, helping departments connect with WHO offices, and ensuring the President’s agenda is advanced across the executive branch.

In the past, the OCA has also tracked the President’s policy agenda to support senior White House staff. The office also keeps track of ethics issues and Hatch Act concerns among Cabinet members and senior staff. The ideal Cabinet Secretary should have strong organizational skills and a background in politics or law, with experience handling high-level officials.

### Office of Public Liaison (OPL)

The OPL builds coalitions and supports the President’s agenda by connecting with social, faith-based, minority, and economic groups. This office helps shape public opinion by keeping supporters, as well as potential opponents, informed about the Administration’s goals.

The OPL, one of the larger White House offices, has a Director who reports to the Chief of Staff and maintains connections with senior staff in all departments and agencies. Since the President’s agenda is always evolving, the OPL holds listening sessions to hear the views of key interest groups.

The OPL has a large team of deputies and special assistants who cover a wide range of interest groups. They hold more meetings than any other White House office, ensuring continuous communication with these groups.

The OPL serves as the White House’s main link to external groups, enforcing its policies while maintaining good relationships. To do this, it uses both incentives and penalties as needed, under the Chief of Staff’s direction. The OPL also plays a significant role in planning the President’s schedule and official travel.

The OPL Director is ideally someone with campaign or Capitol Hill experience but without strong connections to special interest groups, which might lead to bias. The Director should be friendly, organized, and able to handle criticism from both within and outside the Administration. Deputies and special assistants in the OPL need to be knowledgeable about the political landscape in Washington, D.C., and have experience working with private industry, labor, and other sectors.

OPL staff interact with more people and offices than any other WHO staffers, so they need to be effective communicators, able to listen to and influence stakeholders. They must also be ready to adjust their roles as Administration priorities change.

### Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA)

The IGA connects the White House to state, county, local, and tribal governments, ensuring that these entities understand the President’s agenda and support it. The IGA is a one-stop resource for all levels of non-federal government.

The IGA is led by a Director with one or two deputies. Staff are responsible for ensuring that state and local perspectives are represented in policy discussions and that the Administration’s goals are communicated to these groups.

The IGA can organize itself in two common ways:

- Deputies and staff cover different types of government.
- Staff members focus on specific regions.

The IGA works with other White House offices like the OPA and OPL, managing staff throughout departments to coordinate on policy. IGA staff must be proactive, good communicators, and skilled at handling complex political issues.

### White House Policy Councils

As the federal government has grown over the past century, it’s become harder for the President to manage all aspects of their agenda alone. To help with this, three White House policy councils—the NSC, NEC, and DPC—were established. Each council is headed by an Assistant to the President and has three main roles:

- **Policy Coordination.** The councils coordinate the development of Administration policies, bringing together input from different departments and agencies. This process ensures that all relevant opinions are considered, and that if there are major disagreements, the issue can be brought to the President for a decision.

- **Policy Advice.** The council heads also act as independent policy advisers to the President, though their role can vary based on the President’s preferences. Some heads act as “honest brokers,” coordinating input from different sides, while others play a more active role in driving policy.

- **Policy Implementation.** Councils also oversee how policy decisions are put into action. This requires ongoing coordination among departments and agencies, especially for complex policies that involve multiple areas.

Each policy council typically uses a tiered process to handle issues:

- **Policy Coordinating Committee (PCC):** Led by a Special Assistant to the President, a PCC includes experts from relevant departments to find areas of agreement or identify any differences.

- **Deputies Committee (DC):** Chaired by the council’s Deputy Assistant and attended by Deputy Secretaries, a DC reviews PCC recommendations and may adjust options for further analysis or compromise.

- **Principals Committee (PC):** If the DC cannot resolve a question, the council Director will lead a PC with senior White House staff and relevant Cabinet members. This is the last step before issues are brought to the President.

The three councils often cover overlapping areas, like immigration, health care, energy, and trade, which can lead to confusion. Identifying these overlaps and assigning them to one council helps speed up the policy process.

While other chapters cover specific policy goals for departments, incoming policy councils will need to act quickly on key issues like China, immigration, energy policy, and defending conservative values on life, religious liberty, and traditional culture.

### National Security Council

The National Security Council (NSC) was created by law to be an interagency group within the White House for managing national security. Its members include the President and Vice President, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, and top intelligence officials.

The National Security Adviser and NSC staff give the President advice on foreign policy and national security and keep communication flowing during crises. The NSC staff has been reduced in recent years to make it more directly accountable to the President.

### National Economic Council

The National Economic Council (NEC) was established in 1993 by executive order. It has four main responsibilities:

- **Coordinate economic policy on both domestic and international issues.**
- **Provide economic policy advice to the President.**
- **Make sure policy decisions match the President’s goals.**
- **Track the implementation of the President’s economic agenda.**

The NEC Director works with Cabinet members and agencies to help the President achieve their economic goals. The NEC covers a wide range of topics, from infrastructure and small business to housing and financial regulation.

The NEC focuses on developing economic policy, while the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) acts as the White House’s research team for economic analysis. The NEC is often led by someone with experience in economic policy, and the CEA by a well-known economist.

### Domestic Policy Council

The Domestic Policy Council (DPC) advises the President on non-economic domestic issues and international topics with a domestic impact, like immigration. Along with the NSC and NEC, it is one of the main policy councils serving the President. The DPC Director is the main adviser on these issues, working with the Cabinet and leading a committee for policy development.

The DPC includes policy experts who develop and advise on specific issues. The council’s priorities should align with the most important issues facing the Administration, such as health care, housing, and immigration.

The DPC also works closely with other offices to promote economic opportunities and private-sector innovation, and its Director should hold regular meetings with leaders from other Executive Office of the President (EOP) offices to ensure good coordination.

Several areas, like innovation and health care reform, are especially important to the DPC’s work in building the Administration’s domestic policy agenda. The DPC should also collaborate with the NSC to improve border security.

### Office of the Vice President (OVP)

In modern history, the Vice President has served as a close adviser to the President, helping to promote and implement the Administration’s goals. The President may allow OVP staff to join White House meetings and policy discussions.

Many Presidents have given the VP an office in the West Wing, making it easier to stay involved in key decisions. Presidents often assign the VP to lead specific initiatives, such as national security, space exploration, and workforce programs.

The VP is also the President of the Senate, casting tie-breaking votes when necessary, and often acts as an ambassador for the Administration in meetings with foreign leaders.

### Office of the First Lady/First Gentleman

The First Lady or First Gentleman plays an important role in supporting the President’s agenda, often taking on specific issues that align with the Administration’s goals. Because the First Spouse isn’t an elected official, they can focus on sensitive social issues without as much political backlash.

The First Spouse usually has a Chief of Staff and a team based in the East Wing of the White House to help carry out their goals, which often reflect their personal interests and areas discussed with the President. Past initiatives have covered topics like bullying, drug abuse, literacy, and fitness for young people.

The First Spouse’s team works closely with the President’s policy staff, Cabinet members, and other White House offices to coordinate efforts and advance the Administration’s agenda.
